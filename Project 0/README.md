### Description
Guess a number

### Case we are solving here
|file|description|
|-|-|
|game.py|computer proposes a number, user guesses|
|game_v2.py, game.ipynb|computer proposes and guesses a number|

#### **game.py**
Computer randomly proposes a number from 1 to 100. You should guess that number by trying - entering your number until match. If you enter wrong number - computer says "less" or "greater", guiding you to correct number.

#### **game_v2.py, game.ipynb**
Here computer proposes a number too. But you pass your guessing-function to test it perfomance.
Call function ```score_game``` with your function name. It makes 1000 runs to estimate average guess count that leads to win.

### 3. Data used
We don't use any external or ready data here. Numbers are generated by built-in python functions.

### 4. History
Added very simple game variant.
Added a function (score_game) that tests solver-function you pass in it. For example you can pass there random_solver ```score_game(random_predict)```
Added some description to *Project 0* and *repository* to help understand and realize what is it.

### 5. Results
Average random tries count is 100.

### 6. Findings
Created my first repository on GitHub using VSCode. Created token. Tested pull, push, commit comments.
Learned how to use Markdown language to make simple and nice notes and project description.
